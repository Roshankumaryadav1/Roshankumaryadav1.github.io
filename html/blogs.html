		<u> Affect of technology in our Daily lives</u>
	</h1>

	<font size="5">
		<p> 
		As we know that our life is progressing in rapid way. And Science and Technology has the Great Role in Our life. In this 21st century many things has been changed, We are living in the digitilized world and this world has become our global village.Without science and technology we cannot even imagine our life. It will be like the "ship without compass" if science and technology will have no role in our life. Every Work that we are doing has the role of technology. Without technology we cannot survive for the single second. For example if we want to travel from one place to another we need the help of vehicle, If we want entertainment we need the help of mobile, pc, laptop etc, If we want to explore the world we need the help of television etc and all of this are the technology.

		Not only this if we want to buy tickets,book hotels,do shopping we can do it from internet online. Science and Technoloy has made our life Easier, Faster, and more fun. Technology has helped us to connect to the people with ease and has made many tasks so easier. We can Communicate from one end of the world to another end of the world with just click in one button.It has made our life more convinent. It is ver happy to see the growing of technology in our life. If technology will stop changing than our life will stop progressing.

	<br><h1> 
		<u>Disadvantages of Technology</u> 
		</h1>
		<font size="5">
		<p> -Causes Distraction of Work</p>
		<p> -Makes Human Lazy</p>
		<p> -Decreases our Creativity level</p>
		<p> -High Maintainance Cost</p>

		At last I wan't to say that Technology is both "Boon" as well as "Curse" for us or Technology has both negative and positive impact in our Environment. But it is also true that if technology will stop changing than our life will stop progressing. So Humans are parasite. If we use Technology only for positive work than the rate of Cyber Crime Will also controll. But we should also not be full dependent on Technology.
